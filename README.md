## Background
The famous three-body problem can be traced back to Newton [1] in 1680s, and attracted many famous mathematicians and physicists such as Euler [2], Lagrange [3] and so on. Poincare [4] found that the first integrals for the motion of three-body system do not exist, and besides orbits of three-body system are rather sensitive to initial conditions. His discovery of the so-called “sensitivity dependence on initial conditions” (SDIC) laid the foundation of modern chaos theory. It well explains why in the 300 years only three families of periodic orbits of three-body system were found by Euler [2] and Lagrange [3], until 1970s when the Broucke-Hadjidemetriou-Henon family of periodic orbits were found [5–9]. The famous figure-eight family was numerically discovered by Moore [10] in 1993 and rediscovered by Chenciner and Montgomery [11] in 2000. In 2013, Suvakov and Dmitrasinovic [12] made a breakthrough to find 13 new distinct periodic orbits by means of numerical methods, which belong to 11 new families. In 2017 Li and Liao [13] found more than six hundred new periodic orbits of three-body system with equal mass, and in 2018 Li et al. [14] further reported more than one thousand new periodic orbits of three-body system with unequal mass. In 2018, Li and Liao [15] reported more than three hundred new collisionless periodic orbits in free-fall three-body problem.

**The following show the details of our newly found periodic orbits.**

On April 28th 2017, we reported **164** families of planar periodic orbits of the three-body system with equal mass and zero angular momentum in case of initial conditions with isosceles collinear configuration, including the well-known Figure-eight family found by Moore in 1993, the 11 families found by Suvakov and Dmitrasinovic in 2013, and more than **100** new families that have been never reported. They are found by means of the search grid 1000 * 1000 for the initial velocities [0,1] * [0,1] within a time interval [0,100]. For more detail, please refer to [arXiv:1705.00527v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00527v2).

On May 30th 2017, we further reported **695** families (including the previous **164** ones) of planar periodic orbits of the three-body system with equal mass and zero angular momentum in case of initial conditions with isosceles collinear configuration. They are found by means of the search grid 4000 * 4000 for the initial velocities [0,1] * [0,1] within a larger time interval [0,200]. More than **600** among them have been never reported, to the best of our knowledge. For more detail, please refer to [arXiv:1705.00527v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00527v3).

On July 11th 2017, the final version was updated on ArXiv, mainly for the modification of the names of these **695** families of periodic orbits of the three-body problems. For details, please refer to [arXiv:1705.00527v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00527v4). It was accepted by ***Science China-Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy*** for the publication on July 11th 2017.

**FIG2. The trajectories of six new periodic orbits with unequal mass. Blue line: body-1, red line: body-2, black line: body-3.**

On September 13th 2017, we reported **1349** families of Newtonian periodic planar three-body orbits with unequal mass and zero angular momentum and the initial conditions in case of isosceles collinear configurations. These **1349** families of the periodic collisionless orbits can be divided into seven classes according to their geometric and algebraic symmetries. Among these **1349** families, **1223** families are entirely new, to the best of our knowledge. For more detail, please refer to [arXiv:1709.04775](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04775).
